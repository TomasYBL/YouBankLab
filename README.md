YouBankLab
A decentralized system where every person owns their financial cloud.
YouBankLab

One-Liner
YouBankLab is building a system where every person becomes their own bank — full control, privacy, and freedom.

Problem
Banks own the money, set the rules, and capture the profits.
- Your deposits generate yield — but you don’t see it.
- One policy change can freeze your account.
- Privacy is gone. Transparency is an illusion.
Gen Z, digital nomads, and small businesses face high friction and lack of trust in traditional banking.

Solution
One person = one bank. 
YouBankLab is a decentralized financial system where:
- Each user owns their own account & identity
- Users can send private P2P payments instantly
- Users co-govern the system via DAO
- Privacy-first tools, yield strategies, and DeFi are integrated without complexity

Vision: Long-term: a global system where each person controls their own financial infrastructure.

Why Now
- Trust in banks is at historic lows
- Crypto adoption is mainstreaming, but usability is lacking
- Privacy tech (zk-proofs, decentralized storage) is ready
- Digital nomads & Gen Z demand independence

Market Opportunity
- 200M+ target users globally: digital nomads, Gen Z, freelancers, small businesses
- Huge overlap with crypto-native, privacy-focused communities

Product Roadmap
- MVP: Identity wallet, P2P payments, DAO governance, privacy settings
- Phase 2: DeFi integration, yield, staking
- Phase 3: Full ecosystem — every individual acts as their own “bank” (lending, investing, governance)

Business Model
- Transaction fees
- Premium privacy subscriptions
- DAO profit sharing
- White-label privacy-as-a-service for partners

Competition
- Neobanks (Revolut, N26) → centralized, convenience-focused
- Crypto wallets (MetaMask) → crypto-only, poor UX
- Identity startups → cover identity but not finance
YouBankLab uniquely combines identity, finance, DAO governance, and privacy.

Team
- Founder: Tomas Novotny— 10+ years in travel & services, community building, 
- Recruiting CTO & blockchain engineers
- Advisors in fintech & legal
- Early NDAs with privacy-tech providers

Vision 
We are building the financial system of the next generation:  
- Decentralized  
- Privacy-first  
- Owned by individuals, not institutions
-   
YouBankLab is building the financial system of the next generation.
Instead of traditional banks controlling money and data, each person owns their own account in a decentralized cloud.
Users control their funds, identity, privacy, and can interact peer-to-peer, creating a new layer of personal financial sovereignty.
MVP focuses on identity wallet, P2P payments, and DAO governance, with the long-term vision of a global network where everyone becomes their own bank.

One person = one bank. A financial revolution for the next generation.
